#<Refractor Challenge>

##Refractor challenege is an assigned task which tests a students capability to refractor or simplify exsiting code. Refractoring is completed to improve design, structure and display consise detailed code without modifying its external or displayable behaviour.

##User Story
AS A student
I WANT to be able to refactor code
SO THAT my code is easy to understand

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:

> **Note**: This layout is designed for desktop viewing, so you may notice that some of the elements don't look like the mock-up at a resolution smaller than 768px. Eventually you'll learn how to make elements responsive so that your web application is optimized for any screen size.
